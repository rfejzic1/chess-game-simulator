# chess-game-simulator

A simple Chess game simulator built in Java as a console application. The program initially does a board setup and allows for the user to enter commands to move chess pieces.

No visualisation is implemented, but could be expanded on this logic. Also, no AI is implemented, but simple rule checking is.
